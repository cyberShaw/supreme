# Sensor Simulation - Warehouse Management

## Description
+ Node-RED helps us to create endpoints for the Machine Learning models and it helps us for real-time simulations
+ Endpoints have been created for a real-time data inputs like Temperature, Humidity, Carbon Dioxide.
+ The saved ML model's weights is used by the endpoints to simulate a real-world environment.
+ The output is shown in the debugger tab.  

## Setup

+ Download Node-RED from [here](https://nodered.org/docs/getting-started/)
+ Install it
+ Open Command Prompt and run ```node-red```
+ Node-RED will open in the browser

## Run

+ Click the Hamburger Menu on the top-right corner
+ Click ```Import```
+ Import simulation.json
+ Click Deploy
